# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Andrei Rotenstein [[https://andreimr.github.io]]
I've finally taken the time to set up this GitHub account, after much procrastination, with the intention of creating repositories to support personal exploration into several topics, as well as a GitHub Pages site documenting it all. The topics are:
 - **Neurosymbolic AI**. I'm fascinated by what so-called foundational models _cannot_ do. They cannot plan or reason, contrary to popular opinion (formally, in the traditional "AI" sense). There are lots of efforts in the research community to imbue models with the missing capabilities. And I'm here for it.
 - **C++ 23**. I taught myself C++ when I was a kid, and so I have always loved that language. I also hate it. (The relationship's complicated.) Those damn ISOC++ working group(s) have overdone it, convoluting the language in order to support features people love in other languages. But I'm compelled to master them here.
 - **Actually _Doing_ Deep Learning**. Deep Learning is really hard to get right, and I care very much about how people manage to do it. My focus is not on theory--actionable theory is sorely lacking, anyway--but on DL as a craft... or as alchemy.
 - **GPU Programming**. I think performance engineering is fun as hell, but I'm really not very good at it. ("Andrei is too much of a theoretician" or "philosopher" are accusations my colleagues level against me regularly.) I'm compelled to become good at it.

These interests are actually at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence research. I used to be an academic who worked at that intersection (Robotics, Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, good old-fashioned AI and Machine Learning) focusing on designing and deploying real systems. Then, I did R&D for a nearly-century-old Japanese manufacturing company. I didn't do much work in that intersection like I thought I would. So I've stopped doing that, with the intention of returning to my root interests.
